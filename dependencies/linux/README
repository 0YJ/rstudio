Component Version Requirements
=============================================================================

RStudio requires relatively recent versions of a number of components. It is
therefore likely to only correctly configure and build on more recent Linux
systems. Specific version requirements for various components include:

- R 2.11.1
- CMake 2.6
- Pango 1.14
- Boost 1.40
- Qt 4.7

Desktop vs. Server Builds
=============================================================================

The dependencies described below are for RStudio desktop and server. If you 
only want to build the server then Qt is not required. In this case you can
invoke the install-dependencies scripts with a --server-only flag, e.g.

./install-dependencies-debian --server-only


Installing Dependencies
=============================================================================

1) R installation - building RStudio requires that a version of R be 
previously installed within a location where the R executable can be run from
the system shell (e.g. /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin). Building R from source
and then executing 'make install' will conform to this requirement as will
installing it using the system standard package management tools (apt-get, 
yum, etc).

2) Run the install-dependencies script appropriate to your platform's
package management system (for server-only builds be sure to include the
--server-only flag as described above):

   ./install-dependencies-debian  
   ./install-dependencies-yum
   ./install-dependencies-zypper


Installing Recent Versions of Boost and Qt 
=============================================================================

The versions of Boost (1.40) and Qt (4.7) required by RStudio are relatively
recent. If you install these components using your system package manager
then the following minimum OS versions are required:

   - Debian 6.0
   - Ubuntu 10.10
   - Fedora 14
   - RedHat/CentOS 6
   - OpenSUSE 11.3

If however you want to install from source on an OS version earlier than those 
listed above then you can install Boost 1.44 and/or Qt 4.7 on any Linux
system using the following scripts:

   rstudio/dependencies/common/install-boost 
   rstudio/dependencies/linux/package/install-qt-sdk
