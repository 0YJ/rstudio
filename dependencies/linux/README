Component Version Requirements
=============================================================================

RStudio requires relatively recent versions of a number of components. It is
therefore likely to only correctly configure and build on more recent Linux
systems. Specific version requriements for various components include

- R 2.10
- CMake 2.6
- Pango 1.20
- Qt 4.6 (only required for desktop builds)

Linux systems known to conform to all requirements (including Qt version 4.6
for desktop builds) include:

- Ubuntu 10.04 (or higher)
- Fedora 13 (or higher) 

Linux systems known to conform to server-only build requirements include:

- Debian 5 (or higher)


Desktop vs. Server Builds
=============================================================================

The dependencies described below are for RStudio desktop and server. If you 
only want to build the server then Qt is not required. In this case you can
invoke the install-dependencies scripts with a --server-only flag, e.g.

./install-dependencies-debian --server-only


Installing Dependencies
=============================================================================

1) R installation - building RStudio requires that a version of R be 
previously installed within a location where the R executable can be run from
the system shell (e.g. /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin). Building R from source
and then executing 'make install' will conform to this requirement as will
installing it using the system standard package management tools (apt-get, 
yum, etc).

2) Run the install-dependencies script appropritate to your platform's
package management system (for server-only builds be sure to include the
--server-only flag as described above)

   ./install-dependencies-debian   OR
   ./install-dependencies-yum

NOTE: If you are installing on a platform that doesn't support the apt-get
or yum package managers you should review the scripts above and ensure the
equivilant dependencies have been satisifed on your system. In order
to install boost you should use the ./install-boost-linux script which
is also contained within the dependencies/linux directory.
