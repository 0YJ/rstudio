Component Version Requirements
=============================================================================

RStudio requires relatively recent versions of a number of components. It is
therefore likely to only correctly configure and build on more recent Linux
systems. Specific version requirements for various components include:

- R 2.11.1
- CMake 2.6
- Pango 1.14
- Boost 1.42
- Qt 4.8 [Required only for Desktop]


Installation of Qt SDK 4.8
=============================================================================

RStudio Desktop requires Qt 4.8 (the most recent version). Qt 4.8 is included 
in only the most up to date Linux distros (e.g. Ubuntu 12.04, Fedora 16, 
OpenSUSE 12.2). Therefore, the install-dependencies scripts referenced below
install a version of the Qt 4.8 SDK into /opt/RStudio-QtSDK (the special 
RStudio prefix on the directory is included so this installation doesn't 
conflict with any other versions of Qt installed on the system).

If you are either building RStudio Server or running a Linux distribution 
that already includes Qt 4.8 you may wish to prevent installation of the
Qt 4.8 SDK. To do this pass the --exclude-qt-sdk flag to the install 
dependencies script, for example:

./install-dependencies-debian --exclude-qt-sdk

More information on running the install-dependencies script is included
in the section below.


Installing Dependencies for Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, RedHat/CentOS, or OpenSUSE
=============================================================================

1) R installation - building RStudio requires that a version of R be 
previously installed within a location where the R executable can be run from
the system shell (e.g. /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin). Building R from source
and then executing 'make install' will conform to this requirement as will
installing it using the system standard package management tools (apt-get, 
yum, etc).

2) Run the install-dependencies script appropriate to your platform's
package management system (to optionally exclude installation of the Qt 4.8
SDK be sure to specify the --exclude-qt-sdk flag as described above).

   ./install-dependencies-debian  
   ./install-dependencies-yum
   ./install-dependencies-zypper
   
The version of Boost (1.42) required by RStudio is relatively recent. If 
you install Boost using your system package manager then the following 
minimum OS versions are required:

   - Debian 6
   - Ubuntu 10.10
   - Fedora 14
   - OpenSUSE 11.4
   
If you aren't building on one of these more recent system versions then
you can satisfy the Boost requirement by running the install-boost script
in dependencies/linux/older (described below).


Installing Dependencies for Other Systems
=============================================================================

If the system you are installing on is either older than the minimum required
versions listed above or another Linux distribution entirely, then you should
do the following to make sure you have fulfilled all dependencies:

1) Using the install-dependencies-* scripts referenced above as a guide,
ensure that all of the referenced libraries are available on your system.

2) Install the Google Web Toolkit (GWT) dependency using the following script:

   dependencies
      common
         install-gwt

3) Install Hunspell dictionaries using the following script:

   dependencies
      common
         install-dictionaries

4) If your system doesn't meet the minimum version requirements for Boost (1.42)
and/or Qt (4.8) then install them using the scripts provided here:

   dependencies
      linux
         install-boost
         install-qt-sdk
         
NOTE: The Boost libraries are not built if the directory 
/usr/local/include/boost already exists.

5) If your system doesn't meet the minimum version requirements for CMake (2.6)
you can download a Linux binary of the latest version of CMake here:
