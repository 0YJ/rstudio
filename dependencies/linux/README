Component Version Requirements
=============================================================================

RStudio requires relatively recent versions of a number of components. It is
therefore likely to only correctly configure and build on more recent Linux
systems. Specific version requirements for various components include:

- R 2.11.1
- CMake 2.6
- Pango 1.14
- Boost 1.40
- Qt 4.7 [Required only for Desktop]

Desktop vs. Server Builds
=============================================================================

The dependencies described below are for RStudio desktop and server. If you 
only want to build the server then Qt is not required. In this case you can
invoke the install-dependencies scripts with a --server-only flag, e.g.

./install-dependencies-debian --server-only


Installing Dependencies
=============================================================================

1) R installation - building RStudio requires that a version of R be 
previously installed within a location where the R executable can be run from
the system shell (e.g. /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin). Building R from source
and then executing 'make install' will conform to this requirement as will
installing it using the system standard package management tools (apt-get, 
yum, etc).

2) Run the install-dependencies script appropriate to your platform's
package management system (for server-only builds be sure to include the
--server-only flag as described above):

   ./install-dependencies-debian  
   ./install-dependencies-yum
   ./install-dependencies-zypper
   
NOTE The versions of Boost (1.40) and Qt (4.7) required by RStudio are
relatively recent. If you install these components using your system
package manager then the following minimum OS versions are required:

Desktop Minimum OS Version:

   - Ubuntu 10.10
   - Fedora 14
   - OpenSUSE 11.4
   
Server Minimum OS Version:

   - Debian 6
   - Ubuntu 10.04
   - Fedora 13
   - OpenSUSE 11.3

Installing Dependencies for Older Systems
=============================================================================

If you want to install from RStudio from source on an OS version earlier
than those listed above then you can install Boost 1.44 and/or Qt 4.7 on
any Linux system using the following scripts:

   rstudio/dependencies/common/install-boost 
   rstudio/dependencies/linux/package/install-qt-sdk

NOTE: when installing the Qt SDK you should accept the default installation
path of /opt/qtsdk-<version>. Doing this enables the RStudio build 
configuration to detect that you are using the Qt SDK and ensure that its
generated binaries have the correct library dependencies (SDK not /usr/lib).

This will enable you to build and install RStudio on any OS where at 
least CMake 2.6 and Pango 1.14 are available, including:

  - Debian 5
  - Ubuntu 9.10
  - RedHat/CentOS 5 (with EPEL enabled)
  - OpenSUSE 11.2

Note that if your system doesn't meet the CMake 2.6 version requirement
you can download a Linux binary of the latest version of CMake here:

  - http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

The version of Pango required by RStudio (1.14) was released in 2006 so
most Linux distributions should meet that requirement. If not, you can
also build Pango from source, see:
