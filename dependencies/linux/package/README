Installing Components for Packaging
=============================================================================

RStudio's binary linux packages are built using the scripts found in 
rstudio/package/linux. These packages are intended to run on the widest
possible variety of target systems so as a result they use embedded
versions of the Boost 1.44 and Qt 4.7 libraries.

The following script installs both Boost and Qt:

   ./install-packaging-dependencies

The components are installed in the following locations:

   - Boost 1.44 in /usr/local/include
   - Qt 4.7 in /opt/qtsdk-<version>


Additional Notes
=============================================================================

- The Qt installation prompts for confirmation of the install location
and approval of the Qt license. 

- The Boost libraries are not built and installed if the directory
/usr/local/include/boost already exists. 

- The Boost libraries are built static/multithreaded.

- For packaged builds of RStudio (when the RSTUDIO_PACKAGE_BUILD CMake 
variable is defined) the RStudio CMake configuration files will look for
Boost and Qt in the locations installed to by this script first, 
in preference to the standard install locations for system package manager
dependencies (e.g. /usr/lib). Further, the Boost libraries will be linked
statically and the Qt libraries will be bundled into the redistributable
binary package. This bundling enables the RStudio packaged binaries to run
on the widest possible variety of target systems.
