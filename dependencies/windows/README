Install Required Applications
=============================================================================

Building RStudio requires installations of a number of applications 
(including R). These applications include:

R:         http://www.r-project.org/ 
CMake:     http://www.cmake.org/ (choose "Add to system path" during install)
QtForWin:  http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/sdk-windows-cpp
Java:      http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads
Ant:       http://code.google.com/p/winant
NSIS:      http://nsis.sourceforge.net


Update System Path
=============================================================================

Building RStudio requires that the CMake, Qt, and MingGW executables be 
accessible via the system path (note that CMake should already be accessible
via the CMake installer if the "Add to system path" option was chosen during
installation). For Qt and MinGW you should ensure that the following 
additional directories are available on the path:

C:\Qt\<QtVersion>\qt\bin
C:\Qt\<QtVersion>\mingw\bin


Install Java Libraries
=============================================================================

JAR files for GWT, Guice, and GIN need to be installed in the src/gwt
directory prior to building. You can download these dependencies at:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio-buildtools/gin.zip
https://s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio-buildtools/guice.zip
https://s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio-buildtools/gwt-2.0.4.zip
https://s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio-buildtools/gwt-incubator-20100204-r1747.jar

Place the unzipped archives into the src/gwt directory. After extraction you should
ensure that the resulting directory structure is:

src
  gwt
    lib
      gin
        <extracted files>
      guice
        <extracted files>
      gwt-incubator
        gwt-incubator-20100204-r1747.jar
    sdk
       <extracted files>

Note that the gwt-2.0.4 directory should be renamed to "sdk" and placed
in the root of the src/gwt directory.


Install Boost
=============================================================================

A set of pre-built boost binaries for Win32 and Win64 are available for
download at: 

https://s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio-buildtools/boost-1.44-win.zip

You should download and extract this archive into the dependencies/windows
directory. After extraction you should ensure that the resulting directory
structure is:

dependencies
  windows
    boost-win
      boost32
      boost64


Install MinGW w64
=============================================================================

For 32-bit builds RStudio uses the MinGW 32-bit compiler bundled with Qt for
Windows. For 64-bit builds RStudio uses MinGW-w64. A pre-built version of 
MinGW-w64 that is hosted on & targets 64-bit windows is available for 
download at:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/rstudio-buildtools/mingw64-2010-10-03.zip

You should download and extract this archive into the dependencies/windows
directory. After extraction the directory structure should be:

dependencies
  windows
    mingw64


NOTE: How to upgrade boost-win.zip
=============================================================================

boost-win.zip is a prepackaged set of boost 1.44 windows headers and
binaries (32 and 64 bit) built for MinGW 4.4. To upgrade to either a new
boost or MinGW version you should download the appropriate boost windows
source archive as well as the pre-built bjam for windows then follow the 
instructions below for 32/64 bit

Win32
---------

(ensure 32 bit mingw is in the path)

bjam --prefix=C:\boost32 toolset=gcc address-model=32 ^ 
 variant=debug,release link=static threading=multi ^ 
 install

Win64
--------- 

(ensure 64 bit mingw is in the path) 

bjam --prefix=C:\boost64 toolset=gcc address-model=64 ^
 variant=debug,release link=static threading=multi ^
 define=BOOST_USE_WINDOWS_H ^
 install

Note the additional define of BOOST_USE_WINDOWS_H required for the 64 bit build 

After this you can create a new boost-win.zip archive using the contents
of the C:\boost32 and C:\boost64 directories.


NOTE: Getting boost to work with mingw w64
=============================================================================

See the following article for general approach/guidelines:

http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/mingw-w64/wiki/Building%20Boost

Note that in order to build rstudio with boost under win64 we had to make
the following additional accomodations:

1) define BOOST_USE_WINDOWS_H to eliminate errors compiling boost::thread
   (see thread: http://lists.boost.org/boost-users/2010/02/55945.php)

2) #undef BOOST_USE_WINDOWS_H prior to including <boost/interprocess/*>
within BoostErrors.hpp

3) add a dummy definitions for boost::thread::tss_cleanup_implemented
   (see ticket: https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/4258)
