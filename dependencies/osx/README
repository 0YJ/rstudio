Install Required Applications
=============================================================================

Building RStudio requires installations of a number of applications 
(including R). These applications include:

- R:         http://www.r-project.org/
- XCode:     http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html
- QtForMac:  http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/sdk-mac-os-cpp
- CMake:     http://www.cmake.org/


Satisfy Additional Dependencies
=============================================================================

Additional dependencies (boost and gwt) can be satisfied by running the
following script:

./install-dependencies-osx

Note that this script includes download, extraction, and compilation of
boost so can take some time (30-60 minutes) to complete.
