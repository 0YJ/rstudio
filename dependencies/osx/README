Install Required Applications
=============================================================================

Building RStudio requires installations of a number of applications 
(including R). These applications include:

- R:         http://www.r-project.org/
- XCode:     https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
- CMake:     http://www.cmake.org/

Note that after installing XCode you should also be sure to install the XCode
Command Line Tools (which can be done by running the following:

xcode-select --install

Satisfy Additional Dependencies
=============================================================================

Additional dependencies can be satisfied by running the following script:

./install-dependencies-osx

Note that this script includes download, extraction, and compilation of
boost so can take some time (30-60 minutes) to complete.

Qt SDK and macOS 10.15 Catalina
=============================================================================
Installation of the Qt SDK via the dependency scripts may fail due to
notarization requirements added to macOS Catalina. If so, manually install
the required version of Qt from the Qt website. Include the macOS and
QtWebEngine components.
