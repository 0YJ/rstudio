## Overview

The Console in the RStudio includes a variety of features intended to make working with R more productive and straightforward. This article reviews these features. Learning to use these features along with the related features available in the [Source](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200484448) and [History](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526217) panes can have a substantial payoff in your overall productivity with R.

## Code Completion

The RStudio supports the automatic completion of code using the **Tab** key. For example, if you have an object named `pollResults` in your workspace you can type `poll` and then **Tab** and RStudio will automatically complete the full name of the object.

The code completion feature also provides inline help for functions whenever possible. For example, if you typed `med` then pressed **Tab** you would see:

Code completion also works for function arguments, so if you typed `median(` and then pressed **Tab** you'd see the following:

## Retrieving Previous Commands

As you work with R you'll often want to re-execute a command which you previously entered. As with the standard R console, the RStudio console supports the ability to recall previous commands using the arrow keys:

-   **Up** --- Recall previous command(s)

-   **Down** --- Reverse of Up

If you wish to review a list of your recent commands and then select a command from this list you can use **Ctrl+Up** to review the list (note that on the Mac you can also use **Command-Up**):

You can also use this same keyboard shortcut to quickly search for commands that match a given prefix. For example, to search for previous instances of the `glimpse` function start typing `glimpse` and then **Ctrl+Up**:

## Console Title Bar

This screenshot illustrates a few additional capabilities provided by the Console title bar:

-   Display of the current version of R and working directory.

-   The ability to interrupt R during a long computation.

-   Minimizing and maximizing the Console in relation to the Source pane (using the buttons at the top-right or by double-clicking the title bar).

- There are two additional tabs **Terminal** and **Background Jobs** which are covered in the [Terminal](../tools/terminal.html) and [Background Jobs](../tools/jobs.html) sections of the User Guide.

-   <kbd>Ctrl+1</kbd> --- Move focus to the Source Editor

-   <kbd>Ctrl+2</kbd> --- Move focus to the Console

-   <kbd>Ctrl+L</kbd> --- Clear the Console

-   <kbd>Esc</kbd> --- Interrupt R
