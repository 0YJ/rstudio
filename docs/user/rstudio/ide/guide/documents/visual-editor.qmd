! NOTE THE VISUAL MARKDOWN EDITING NEEDS TO BE TAKEN DOWN EVENTUALLY

The Quarto visual editor provides a [WYSIWYM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM) editing interface for all of Pandoc markdown, including tables, citations, cross-references, footnotes, divs/spans, definition lists, attributes, raw HTML/TeX, and more. The visual editor also includes support for executing code cells and viewing their output inline:

![An RMarkdown file opened in the RStudio visual editor. The page is titled 'Filter joins'. Underneath is a table containing R syntax, mathematical notation, and definitions for the semi- and anti-joins. Underneath this table is an R code chunk that displays a graphical representation of a semi-join.](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/images/visual-editing.png){alt="An RMarkdown file opened in the RStudio visual editor. The page is titled 'Filter joins'. Underneath is a table containing R syntax, mathematical notation, and definitions for the semi- and anti-joins. Underneath this table is an R code chunk that displays a graphical representation of a semi-join."}

The visual editor doesn't attempt to abstract away or obscure the underlying markdown document. Rather, it aims to provide a highly productive writing interface for people that love markdown. You can also still use most markdown constructs (e.g., \## or **bold**) directly for formatting.

### Switching Modes

Markdown documents can be edited in either source or visual mode. To switch into visual mode for a given document, use the Source or Visual button at the top-left of the document toolbar (or alternatively the ⌘⇧ F4 keyboard shortcut):

Note that you can switch between source and visual mode at any time (editing location and undo/redo state will be preserved when you switch).

## Using the Editor

### Keyboard Shortcuts

There are keyboard shortcuts for all basic editing tasks. Visual mode supports both traditional keyboard shortcuts (e.g. ⌘ B for bold) as well as markdown shortcuts (using markdown syntax directly). For example, enclose `**bold**` text in asterisks or type `##` and press space to create a second level heading. Here are some of the most commonly used shortcuts:

| Command      | Keyboard Shortcut | Markdown Shortcut |
|--------------|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| Bold         |        ⌘ B        |    `**bold**`     |
| Italic       |        ⌘ I        |    `*italic*`     |
| Code         |        ⌘ D        |   `` `code` ``    |
| Link         |        ⌘ K        |     `<href>`      |
| Heading 1    |       ⌥⌘ 1        |        `#`        |
| Heading 2    |       ⌥⌘ 2        |       `##`        |
| Heading 3    |       ⌥⌘ 3        |       `###`       |
| R Code Chunk |       ⌥⌘ I        | ```` ```{r} ````  |

See the [editing shortcuts](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/options.html#shortcuts) article for a complete list of all shortcuts.

### Insert Anything

You can also use the catch-all ⌘ / shortcut to insert just about anything. Just execute the shortcut then type what you want to insert. For example:

![There is a line of text (with a cursor at the end) where someone has typed '/lis'. There is a drop-down menu underneath this with options for 'Bullet List', 'Numbered List', and 'Definition List' arranged vertically. The title of each item is bolded, has a small icon to the left, and a small description in lighter gray text underneath it.](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/images/visual-editing-omni-list.png){alt="There is a line of text (with a cursor at the end) where someone has typed '/lis'.

The title of each item is bolded, has a small icon to the left, and a small description in lighter gray text underneath it."}

![There is a line of text (with a cursor at the end) where someone has typed '/ma'. There is a drop-down menu underneath this with options for 'Inline Math', 'Display Math', and 'Image\...' arranged vertically. The title of each item is bolded, has a small icon to the left, and a small description in lighter gray text underneath it.](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/images/visual-editing-omni-math.png){alt="There is a line of text (with a cursor at the end) where someone has typed '/ma'.

The title of each item is bolded, has a small icon to the left, and a small description in lighter gray text underneath it."}

If you are at the beginning of a line (as displayed above), you can also enter plain `/` to invoke the shortcut.

### Editor Toolbar

The editor toolbar includes buttons for the most commonly used formatting commands:

Additional commands are available on the **Format**, **Insert**, and **Table** menus:

| Format                                                                                                                                                                       | Insert                                                                                                                                                                       | Table                                                                                                                                                                     |
