RStudio provides "Push button deployment" to Posit Connect, Shinyapps.io, and RPubs.com. [Posit Connect](https://www.posit.co/products/connect/) supports a spectrum of data products, static or dynamic, developed in R and Python: Dashboards, applications, APIs, reports, and so much more. Connect enables flexible permissions configurations and meets all enterprise security requirements. Shinyapps.io supports hosting of Shiny for R and Python, and RPubs.com supports hosting of static-content only.

## Connecting Your Account

Install the [rsconnect](https://rstudio.github.io/rsconnect/) R package, which is required for publishing:

```r
install.packages("rsconnect")
# or the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/rsconnect")
```

You'll need to connect RStudio to the remote hosting environment (e.g. Posit Connect, Shinyapps.io, RPubs.com) and authorize RStudio to use your account. To add a publishing account to RStudio, press **Tools** in the main menu, then **Global Options\...**.

In the Options panel that appears, choose **Publishing** in the sidebar, and use the **Connect\...** button to add a new account.

Once you have successfully configured the connection within RStudio, you may now publish content to Posit Connect or Shinyapps.io.
