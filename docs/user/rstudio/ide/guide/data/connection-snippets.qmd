title: "Connection Snippets"
---

RStudio connections can be extended through:

1.  **Snippet Files** on a server-based version of RStudio that provide support for new connections using R templates that enable users and system administrators to list and create new connections.

2.  **Packages** that do one or more of the following:

    -   Implement the [Connections Contract](connections-contract.html) to manage and explore data in the **Connections** Pane and/or

    -   Supply Snippet Files or a Shiny Application to extend the **New Connection** dialog.

## Snippet Files

A Connection Snippet File is an R code snippet with additional metadata which is intended to initialize a connection. This file can be as simple as:

    library(readr)
    data <- read_csv(readr_example("mtcars.csv"))

This snippet can be saved on a server-based version of RStudio under `/etc/rstudio/connections/`. Once that file is created and RStudio is restarted, RStudio will make this connection available as "Motor Trend Cars" underneath **Connect to Existing Data Sources**:

### Snippet test

The snippet can also be tested by pressing the **Test** button in the **New Connection** wizard. Testing will return either a success or failure based on the available code snippet.

### Snippet customization

The path is configurable through the `connections-path` environment variable and multiple connection files can be specified.

In order to parameterize this connection, one can create fields using using the `${Position:Label=Default}` syntax:

-   **Position:** The row position starting at zero.

-   **Label:** The label assigned to this field.

-   **Default:** An optional default value.

For example, a filter interface for this dataframe can be added with the following connection snippet:

    library(readr)
    data <- read_csv(readr_example("mtcars.csv"))
    data[data$mpg == ${0:Miles per Gallon=21.4} | data$cyl == ${1:Cylinders=6}, ]

In order to create a `;` separated list of values, use the syntax `${Position:Label=Default:Key}`. Semicolon-separated list are common in database connections and therefore, natevely supported in snippet files, for instance:

    "${2:Letters=ABC:LettersKey}${3:Numbers=123:NumbersKey}"

There are several escape characters supported: `$colon$` to escape `:` and `$equal` to escape `=`.

## R Packages

R packages provide the **New Connection** integration to both server and desktop based versions of RStudio.

### Package structure

A package supporting connections defines the following components:

-   **Connections File:** A DCF file must be created under `inst/rstudio/connections.dcf` to enumerate each connection supported in the package.

-   **Snippet Files:** Snippet files are stored under `inst/rstudio/connections/`.

As a quick start, the [Rstudio Connections Example](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio-connections-example) GitHub repo contains a working example of this structure.

### Connections contract

You can integrate with RStudio's Connection Pane to allow users to explore connections created with your R package by using the [Connections Contract](connection-contracts.html).

### Snippet files

Snippet Files are specified under the `/inst/rstudio/connections` and follow the same syntax mentioned in the "Snippet Files" section.

### Shiny application

For advanced connection interfaces, a shiny application can be specified. See [sparklyr](https://github.com/rstudio/sparklyr/blob/master/R/connection_shinyapp.R) for a working application.
