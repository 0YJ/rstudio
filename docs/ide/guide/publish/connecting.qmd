Log into Connect and click **Connect** to authorize the IDE to deploy on your behalf. Then return to the IDE and click the **Connect Account** button.

Once you have successfully configured the RStudio IDE, you may now publish content to RStudio Connect.

If you are ready to publish content to RStudio Connect, continue to the [Publishing](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/publishing/) chapter.

## Update the IDE

You will need to install at least version 1.0.44 of the RStudio IDE to interact with Connect. You can confirm this by opening the IDE and clicking "Help" \> "About RStudio" and checking the version number at the top of that pane. If you are not running at least version 1.0.44, you should [download the latest release](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
