## R Notebook

This is an R Notebook. Notebook content is written using Markdown, a simple formatting syntax. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can execute R code inside the notebook and see the results immediately beneath. Try executing this chunk by placing your cursor inside it and pressing **Ctrl+Shift+Enter** (Cmd+Shift+Enter on OS X).

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Output Types

R code chunks can also produce plots and even HTML widgets. Try running this chunk, which produces a plot:

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

## Viewing and Sharing

When you save an R Notebook, a file with the extension `.nb.html` containing a rendered copy of the notebook is placed alongside your source file. Press the **Preview** button in the toolbar to see this file at any time. 

This self-contained HTML file includes both the notebook's source code and its output.
