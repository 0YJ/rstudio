Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory includes QtDBus Proxies for Evince. They were initially 
generated by using the qdbusxml2cpp utility on the evince Daemon and 
Window intefaces. The Daemon interface was obtained using this command:

dbus-send --session --type=method_call --print-reply \
  --dest=org.gnome.evince.Daemon /org/gnome/evince/Daemon \
  org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable.Introspect

The Window interface was obtained from the introspection_xml[] static
in ev_window.c (from the evince source code).

We are maintaining these interfaces manually now because (a) there
was a problem marshalling the point structure which we couldn't
work around; and (b) we need to modify the Window interface to 
deal with the fact that pre 2.9.1 versions of evince don't include 
a timestamp parameter.

Evince Synctex Changes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- In Evince 2.91.3 a timestamp paramter was added to the synctex
dBus interface (see: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=632313).
So for versions of Evince prior to that the timestamp parameter 
needs to be ommitted.
 
- In Evince 3.1.90 the synctex library version was updated to 1.16

- In Evince 3.3.2 the synctex library was updated to 1.17 -- this resolved
issues with finicky file paths. Therefore, when running against 
earlier versions of Evince we need to be sure to pass ther right paths.
