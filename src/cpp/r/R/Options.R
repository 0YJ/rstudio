# the above two display oriented command affect the behavior of edit.data.frame

# than .Internal(dataentry, ...) if DISPLAY == "" or if the .Platform$GUI is
# "unknown". since we plan on running on a server without X available we need
# to manually make sure that the DISPLAY environment variable exists and that
# the .Platform$GUI is not "unknown"
